# mc-bedrock-autoupdater
Program to automate the process of updating Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server

I'm working on making this more accessible but for now this script assumes your bedrock-server and this repo is in your home directory

# Install golang

>https://go.dev/doc/install

# git clone this repo into your home directory

```git clone https://github.com/sxmber/mc-bedrock-autoupdater```

# cd into the repo and build the golang binary

``` go build  ```

# Write the latest bedrock server version installed into vers.txt
